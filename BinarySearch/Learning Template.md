# Problem Name:

## 1️⃣ Problem Summary
- What is being asked?
- Input constraints?
- Expected complexity?

---

## 2️⃣ My First Thinking (Before Solution)
- What did I try first?
- Why did brute force come to mind?
- What confused me?
- Where did I get stuck?

(THIS SECTION IS MOST IMPORTANT)

---

## 3️⃣ Key Observation (Turning Point)
- What made the problem easier?
- Sorted property?
- Monotonic condition?
- Overlapping subproblems?
- Structure (tree/graph)?

This is where real learning happens.

---

## 4️⃣ Final Approach (In Words)
Explain step-by-step logic WITHOUT code.

If you can’t explain in words,
you don’t understand it.

---

## 5️⃣ Clean Implementation (Final Code Only)
One clean version.
No clutter.
No multiple versions.
Just the optimal solution.

---

## 6️⃣ Mistakes I Made
- Boundary error?
- Wrong condition?
- Forgot edge case?

This prevents future panic.
